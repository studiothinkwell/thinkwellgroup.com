About Polpo
-----------

Polpo is a Drupal 6 admin theme created by Australian Drupal developers <PreviousNext> (http://www.previousnext.com.au) that aims to make Drupal administration tasks easier for large corporate and novice users alike.

Specifically designed for making administration tasks clearer and easier to navigate, Polpo uses a fluid two column layout ideal for content editing on larger screen resolutions. This is achieved through the use of larger font sizes, clearer spacing and distinct colours to aid the usability of common tasks. Many of these approaches are being adopted for the new Drupal 7 admin interface, so Polpo aims to bring some of these ideas to sites currently running Drupal 6.

Features include being able to customise the header colour and logo to match a client's branding and a "Fast Tasks" link block that provides quick access to commonly used tasks from any screen.

To take full advantage of Polpo's features, we recommend it is installed in conjunction with the Administration Menu (Contributed - http://drupal.org/project/admin_menu) and Color (Drupal Core - Optional) modules.

Polpo is currently in Beta release, so please report any issues or desired enhancements you'd like to info@previousnext.com.au.


Installation
------------

1) Download the Polpo theme folder and install it in your site's theme directory at sites/all/themes

2) Download and install the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/admin_menu">Administration Menu</a> in your site's module directory at sites/all/modules 

3) Activate the Administration Menu and Color modules from Administer > Site Building > Modules

4) Activate the Polpo theme from the administration section of your Drupal site at Administer > Site Building > Themes. Please note that you should not set Polpo as the default theme, as it has not been designed as a public-facing theme for general content.

5) To customise the Polpo theme settings, click on the "Configure" link next to the Polpo theme details. You can change the theme colours and default logo from this page. Logos should be exactly 100 pixels high and saved as transparent PNG files with the background colour set to be transparent. You can also turn off the "Fast Tasks" menu from this page. All other regular settings like Blocks can be customised as desired.

6) Go to the "Administration Theme" section of your Drupal site at  Administer > Site Configuration > Administration Theme. Select "Polpo" from the drop down menu and tick the "Use administration theme for content editing" checkbox, then click "Save configuration". This will enable Polpo as your administration theme.
